   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start Local Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Start DynamoDB Local (in separate terminal)
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 amazon/dynamodb-local

   # Start Backend (in separate terminal)
   cd backend
   mvn quarkus:dev

   # Start Frontend
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the Application**

## Coding Standards

### Backend (Java/Quarkus)
- Follow Java naming conventions
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add JavaDoc comments for public methods
- Handle exceptions appropriately
- Write unit tests for new functionality

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Ensure responsive design

### General
- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Use conventional commit format:
  ```
  feat: add new encryption feature
  fix: resolve decryption bug
  docs: update API documentation
  test: add unit tests for encryption service
  ```

## Testing

### Backend Testing
```bash
cd backend
mvn test                    # Run unit tests
mvn verify                  # Run integration tests
mvn test -Dtest=TestClass   # Run specific test class
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd frontend
npm test                    # Run test suite
npm run test:coverage      # Run tests with coverage
```

### Test Coverage Requirements
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Test both happy path and error scenarios
- Include integration tests for API endpoints

## Security Considerations

### Before Contributing
- **Never commit sensitive data** (API keys, passwords, personal information)
- **Use environment variables** for configuration
- **Follow secure coding practices**
- **Test for common vulnerabilities** (XSS, CSRF, injection attacks)

### Security Testing
- Run security linters before committing
- Test for input validation
- Verify encryption/decryption works correctly
- Check for information leakage
